# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description: I used this SQL injection:

' OR SLEEP(3)=0--'

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description: Url Used: /public/hacktools/change_session_id.php
Attacker browser: EDGE (On the left)
Target Browser: Firefox (On the right)
Both browsers had different cookies. Session Hijacking was demonstrated on the first part of the gif. The cookies of the Firefox browser was stolen and used to login using the Edge browser. Session fixation was demonstrated on the second part of the gif. Cookies of the Firefox browser replaced with that of the Edge browser. I logged in using the Firefox browser and was also able to successfully login using the Edge browser.

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration

Description: <img src="green-USER_ENU.gif">


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description: <img src="red-IDOR.gif">

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Description: I demonstrated that the green target and the red target were not vulnerable to CSRF. Only the Red target had this vulnerability
